# CSS calc() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The problem arises when calculating a width based on a percentage of the parent container's width, but the parent's width is not explicitly defined.

## Problem

The `calc()` function in CSS is powerful for dynamic calculations, however, it relies on the context.  If the parent element lacks an explicitly set width (e.g., using `width: 500px;`, `width: 80%;`, or other width-setting techniques), the calculation can yield unpredictable results.  This may lead to different rendering across browsers.

## Solution

A reliable solution involves ensuring the parent element's width is defined explicitly, thereby providing a solid foundation for the `calc()` function's computation.  You can set the width to either a fixed pixel value or a percentage of its containing element. This provides a consistent reference for the calculation.
