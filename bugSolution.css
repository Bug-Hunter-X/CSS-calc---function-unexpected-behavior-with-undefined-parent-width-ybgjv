To resolve this issue, ensure that the parent element has a defined width. Here's how you can modify the CSS:

```css
/* Define the width of the parent element */
div.parent {
  width: 80%; /* or any suitable value */
}

div.child {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

By setting the width of the parent `.parent` container, we provide the `calc()` function within the child element `.child` with a stable base for its calculation, preventing unexpected outcomes.
