The following CSS code snippet causes an unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This calculation might lead to unexpected results if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  The `calc()` function depends on the parent's dimensions, and if it's not specified, the calculation fails to give the expected outcome.
